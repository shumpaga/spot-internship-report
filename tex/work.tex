\chapter{Completed work}
The principal purpose of this internship is to improve an algorithm already implemented and used to
minimize \textit{deterministic} $\omega$-automaton. The source code associated is the result of two papers:
\textbf{SAT-based Minimization of Deterministic $\omega$-Automata}\cite{15} and
\textbf{Mechanizing the Minimization of Deterministic Generalized Büchi Automata}\cite{14} which are
themselves a generalization of \textbf{Ehlers} SAT' based procedure \cite{17}.\\

Also note that the first paper is an extension of the second which is restricted to generalized-Büchi
acceptance.

\section{Specifications}
This section tries to shed light on what was before and what is now in Spot.

\subsection{Overall goal}
Both papers introduce an algorithm to minimize any \textit{deterministic} $\omega$-automaton.
